        <p>
            Here's an applet that tries to write to the file named "writetest".
        </p>
        <p>
            <applet code=WriteFile.class width=500 height=150>
            </applet></p>
        <p>
            If you don't see the applet, download and install
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
                the KDJ or EEJ.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the <a href="WriteFile.java">source</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This applet won't work unless you've configured your policy
            to allow it to write such a file; if not, you
            will see an AccessControlException.

            If you've configured your system to
            allow applets from this applets' location to write the specified file,
            check your current directory!
            You'll find a file there named "writetest".
