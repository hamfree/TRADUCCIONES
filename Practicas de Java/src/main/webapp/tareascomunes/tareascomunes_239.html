    <br>Most applications use
    <i>code tables</i>. A reasonable definition of a code table might
    be:
    <p>
      <i>A code table is a list of closely related items, each of
        which has minimal substructure.</i>
    </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a list of countries (or other geographical category)</li>
      <li>the list of credit cards accepted by a web site -
        Mastercard, Visa, etc.</li>
      <li>the number of items shown to the user in a search
        result - 10, 50, 100</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Code tables are often presented in drop down lists, as in:</p>
    <p></p>
    <form action="TopicAction.do?Id=239" method="GET">
      <table style="border-spacing: 0px">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Number of Results:</td>
            <td><select name="NumResults">
                <option selected="selected">10</option>
                <option>50</option>
                <option>100</option>
              </select></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Flavor of Ice Cream:</td>
            <td><select name="Flavor">
                <option value="1" selected="selected">Chocolate</option>
                <option value="2">Strawberry</option>
                <option value="3">Vanilla</option>
              </select></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </form>
    <p>(Radio buttons or other presentation styles may also be
      appropriate, according to the needs of each case.)</p>
    <p>
      <b>Code Table Structure</b><br> Most applications use a
      relational database. Code tables usually represent the simplest
      kinds of tables that you can model in a database. Here are some
      example code tables, as defined by SQL
      <code>CREATE TABLE</code>
      statements:
    </p>
    <p>Number of items shown in a search result:</p>
    <pre>CREATE TABLE NumResults (  
  Id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  NumItems TINYINT UNSIGNED UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
  PRIMARY KEY (Id)
) TYPE=InnoDB;</pre>
    <p>List of countries supported by an application:</p>
    <pre>CREATE TABLE Country (
  Id MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  Text VARCHAR(50)UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  ShortText VARCHAR(2)UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (Id)
) TYPE=InnoDB;</pre>
    <p>The same list of countries, but with a field added to control
      sort order:</p>
    <pre>CREATE TABLE Country (
  Id MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  OrderWith MEDIUMINT UNIQUE UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  Text VARCHAR(50)UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  ShortText VARCHAR(2)UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (Id)
) TYPE=InnoDB;</pre>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">It's often useful to picture each
        row in a code table as representing a set of <i>aliases</i>
        for a single idea.
      </span> One alias can be more appropriate than another, according to
      the context in which it's used. For example, in a report which
      tries to squeeze as much information as possible onto pages of
      fixed width, short abbreviations are often useful. When
      presenting a drop-down list to an end user, it may be more
      desirable to show a longer description, instead of an
      abbreviation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, you may decide to represent an item in a code table using
      what amounts to several <i>aliases</i> for the same item:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a numeric id</li>
      <li>the 'regular' text, usually seen by the user</li>
      <li>a short abbreviation used when appropriate</li>
      <li>some other alias appropriate to a given case</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For this idea to make sense, each of the above fields would need
      a
      <code>UNIQUE</code>
      constraint, and each would need to be non-null.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Code Table Evolution</b><br> As shown above, code tables
      don't have a specific, definitive structure. You aren't locked
      into a specific style. A single application often has many code
      tables, but those code tables don't necessarily share the exact
      same form. Also, it's not uncommon for a code table to start its
      life in a simple form, and then later grow into something more
      elaborate. In this sense, code tables are roughly similar to
      Java's <a
        href="http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=1">enumeration
        types</a>, which can start out being very simple. Since
      enumerations are also classes, you can add more structure to
      them later, if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>In-Memory Caching</b><br> Code tables often represent
      relatively static data. Since the data doesn't change very
      often, it usually makes sense to consider reading in all code
      tables once upon startup. Then, each time a code table is
      needed, the in-memory representations of the code tables are
      referenced directly, instead of repeatedly going back to the
      database. This usually improves application performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>In-Memory Joins</b><br> If code tables are cached in
      memory after startup, then you will often be able to move logic
      formerly implemented by a database
      <code>JOIN</code>
      operation into in-memory operations in Java instead. (This is an
      exception to the rule of <a
        href="http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=106">not
        performing database tasks in code</a>.) There are two advantages
      to this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>it will likely improve performance.</li>
      <li>your SQL statements will be simpler, since the <code>JOIN</code>s
        can be left out
      </li>
    </ul>
    For illustration, consider an application that models a team sport,
    in which each player on a team is assigned a specific
    <i>position</i> of some sort (bowler, pitcher, fullback, or
    whatever). In this case, the Team table has a foreign key into the
    Position code table. To retrieve the list of players on a team, you
    might have an explicit join to the Position code table, as in :
    <pre>SELECT 
 Name, Number, PositionName
FROM 
 Team JOIN Position ON PositionFK = Position.Id
WHERE
 Team.Id = ?</pre>
    Alternatively, the JOIN might be dropped in favor of returning the
    'raw' PositionFK identifier, instead of the PositionName text, as in
    :
    <pre>SELECT 
 Name, Number, PositionFK
FROM 
 Team
WHERE 
 Team.Id = ?</pre>
    <p>Of course, the PositionFK identifier would need to be
      translated into text (in Java-land) before presenting the result
      to the user.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Id For Code, Text For User</b><br> The fact that a code
      table item is essentially a collection of aliases for a single
      idea can be put to use in the following way. In Java-land, it's
      best to identify items using internal, static codes, instead of
      the text visible to the user. Forms in web applications are a
      good example of this:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;select name="Flavor"&gt;
  &lt;option value='1'&gt;Chocolate&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value='2'&gt;Strawberry&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value='3'&gt;Vanilla&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;</pre>
    Here, the text ('Chocolate') is shown to the user in a drop-down,
    but the value submitted to the server is actually a numeric id
    ('1'), as controlled by the
    <code>value</code>
    attribute of the
    <code>option</code>
    tag. This separates two things nicely. The text may change for many
    reasons (change the spelling, add translations into another
    language), but such changes will not ripple into Java, since
    Java-land uses numeric codes, not the text. (Some object to exposing
    database primary keys to the end user like this. But in this case,
    it doesn't seem to do any harm.)
    <p>
      <b>Sorting</b><br> Sorting of code tables can be tricky. If
      the sort is alphabetical, then that's simple to implement.
      However, sorts aren't always alphabetical. Sometimes they depend
      on arbitrary rules. For example, if an application is used only
      in Australia, a list of countries having Australia and New
      Zealand at the beginning may be required. In such cases, one
      option is to define a column in the underlying code table which
      explicitly defines the sort order.
    </p>
    <p>The sort order can also be affected by whether an application
      is multilingual. If a code table is sorted alphabetically in
      each language, then the order of presentation to the user will
      usually not be the same in all languages.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Monster Code Tables</b><br> Some applications put all of
      their code tables into a single "monster" code table. The
      monster code table has two primary keys -- one to identify the
      code table, and one to identify the value <i>within</i> the code
      table. This seems to be an inferior design:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>it lumps together items which aren't logically related
        to each other. It's almost always a mistake to <i>put
          implementation details before meaning</i>. That's a bad
        sign.
      </li>
      <li>foreign keys to code tables are no longer possible.
        Since foreign keys are the heart and soul of a relational
        database, this is a major drawback.</li>
      <li>since some foreign keys are absent, the clarity of a
        database's structure (and related SQL statements) is
        significantly reduced.</li>
      <li>when a single code table has special needs, then it
        usually can't fit into the structure of the monster code
        table.</li>
      <li>code tables can't evolve independently and still remain
        in the monster code table.</li>
      <li>JOINs to monster code tables are usually doubled. What
        used to be a single join becomes 2 joins -- one join to
        define the code table, another to define the value <i>within</i>
        the code table.
      </li>
      <li>in large SQL statements, the large number of joins can
        rapidly become annoying.</li>
    </ul>
