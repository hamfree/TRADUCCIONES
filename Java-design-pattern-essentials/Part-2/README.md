# Parte II. Patrones creacionales

This part describes the five creational patterns, that is, those that help manage the instantiation of objects.

* Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes;
* Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations;
* Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate;
* Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying the prototype;
* Singleton: Ensure a class allows only one object to be created, providing a single point of access to it.
