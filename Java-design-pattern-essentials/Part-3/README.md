# Parte III. Patrones estructurales

This part describes the seven structural patterns, that is, those that help manage how classes are organised and interrelate.

* _Adapter_: Convert the interface of a class into the interface clients expect, letting classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible types;
* _Bridge_: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that each may vary independently;
* _Composite_: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, letting client objects treat individual objects and compositions uniformly;
* _Decorator_: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically;
* _Façade_: Provide a uniform interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, by defining a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use;
* _Flyweight_: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently;
* _Proxy_: Provide a surrogate or place-holder for another object to control access to it.
