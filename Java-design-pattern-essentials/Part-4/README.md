# Parte IV. Patrones de comportamiento

This part describes the eleven behavioural patterns, that is, those that help manage what the classes actually do.

* _Chain of Responsibility_: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object the chance to handle the request;
* _Command_: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterise clients with different requests;
* _Interpreter_: Define the representation of a language’s grammar;
* _Iterator_: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation;
* _Mediator_: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact;
* _Memento_: Capture and externalise an object’s state so that it can be restored to that state later;
* _Observer_: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically;
* _State_: Allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes, as if it were a different class;
* _Strategy_: Allow clients to change the algorithm that an object uses to perform a function;
* _Template Method_: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses;
* _Visitor_: Simulate the addition of a method to a class without needing to actually change the class.
