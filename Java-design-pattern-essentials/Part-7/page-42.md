# Apéndice B. Referencia rápida de patrones de diseño

This appendix provides an alphabetical quick-reference of each of the 23 main design patterns described in this book in their most general form.

Note that many of the patterns make use of abstract classes or interfaces. In most cases these are interchangeable and the choice of which to use depends entirely upon your project requirements. It may also appear that the general form of a particular pattern described in this chapter differs from the detailed example in the main body of this book, but this is just a consequence of the fact that patterns are adaptable to the needs of the situation, and the general form should not be construed as the only or 'correct' approach.
